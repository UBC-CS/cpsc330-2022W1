    "- Machine learning is a different paradigm for problem solving.    \n",
    "- Very often it reduces the time you spend programming and helps customizing and scaling your products. \n",
    "- In supervised learning we are given a set of observations ($X$) and their corresponding targets ($y$) and we wish to find a model function $f$ that relates $X$ to $y$.\n",
    "- You should be ready with the technology stack on your laptop now. If you were not able to do it during lecture time or you ran into trouble, post on Piazza or attend one of the tutorials or office hours. \n",
    "- Carefully read the course website. Make sure to complete the surveys. \n",
    "- **The teaching team is here to help you learn the material and succeed in the course!**\n",
